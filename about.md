# About this Site
I used to blog using wordpress for sometime. I got tired of it and it's endless updates. I like something as simple as text files. Good folks at GitHub and Jekyl enabled blogging with very little bells and whistles. 

This template is derived from the Jekyll theme used in [Andrej Karpathy's blog](http://karpathy.github.io/).
