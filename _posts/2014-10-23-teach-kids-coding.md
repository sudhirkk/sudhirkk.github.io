Should we teach our children to code? I say yes.

 * Because it gives them the ability to see what’s going on under the hood.
 * Because it sharpens their logical reasoning.
 * Because it empowers them to create instead of consume.
 * Because they may just like it and someday they might want to make a living out of coding.
 * Because it makes them “cool” among their peers.
 * Because it helps them to work better with computer professionals even if they chose a different line of specialization.
 * Because it is pure fun. Coding gives them instant gratification. Working code can show them magic unfolding in front of their eyes.

I am sure I wasn’t persuasive enough but I would urge to give it a try. There are tons of resources out there online to help you choose the right toolkit. It will be a true gift to your children.

To begin with here are a couple of links to checkout. [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) from MIT is really easy and fun for young kids of age 5-8. MIT's [App Inventor](http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/) (created by Google and later donated to MIT) lets you create real Android apps using some of the event driven programming concepts. It is appropriate for ages 9-15. Lego like programming interface makes coding fun and engaging. Both are great tools for teaching.
